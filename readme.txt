This program moves a complex folder-file-structure from a (personal) drive into a shared drive while maintaining the structure
and accounting for missing ownership rights that effectively hinder the moving of any files.

Prerequirements:
- local Google Drive for Desktop installation
- identified locations from where to where files and sub-folders should be moved
- python libraries installed etc


NB: this is not a fully functional close exe and parameter-specification was left intentionally in the python script part - you will have to open
it and specify parameters there. Currently, there doesnt seem to be a need to further finalize this into a publishable / more user-friendly version.
